My name is Günay Mert Karadoğan. I'm currently working at Facebook. This is my blog, **Shape of Code**. 
The name comes from one of my all-time favourite songs, **Shape of My Heart**. 
It was just a coincidence that I was listening to Sting when I was looking for a name for my blog. 
It could also have been **Fragile Code**, **Coder Man in Dublin** or **Codexanne**. 

Here I'm intending to write about my side projects. These days they are mostly with `TypeScript`, `GraphQL`, `React.js`. 
Give me a shout if you have any interesting projects that you want to collaborate.
