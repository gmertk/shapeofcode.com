My name is Günay Mert Karadoğan.

I work at Facebook as a Developer Support Engineer.

This is my blog, **Shape of My Code**. I was listening to Sting when I was looking for a name for my blog. It could also have been **Fragile Code**, **Coder Man in Dublin** or **Codexanne**.

Here I'll write about my side projects - mostly with `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `GraphQL`, `React.js` and `React Native`.

Give me a shout on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gunaymertk) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gmertk/) if you have any interesting projects to collaborate.
